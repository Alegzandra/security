security
========

This is the project I've made for my computer security class.
In order to work you must download the nmap tool from nmap.org and also VPython.
main.py shall be opened with vidle.

The program shows the route (path) across an IP network by displaying spheres on each network node
that the packages must come across while travelling through their destination.
Clicking on one of the spheres will show the active ports on the respective node by calling the nmap tool.
Use it wisely.
